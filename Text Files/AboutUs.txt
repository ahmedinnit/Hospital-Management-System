Shalamar Hospital is committed in the delivery of its tripartite mission of exemplary patient care, high-impact researchand education. Over the last 44 years, Shalamar Hospital has evolved into a premier tertiary care medical facility with 500 beds and 25 clinical departments and specialties equipped with world-class diagnostic and treatment facilities.     Situated at Shalimar Link Road, the 18-acre establishment was originally instituted as a Businessmen Hospital Trust as a50 bed organisation in 1978 with six outpatient departments. It was the culmination of strenuous efforts by its members Chaudary Nazar Mohammad (late) and his esteemed partners, Mr Mohammad Hussain (late), Mr. Naseem Saigol, Mr. Mumtaz A   Sheikh, and Syed Babar Ali with kind assistance from the Punjab government. At Shalamar Hospital, we strongly believe inequitable health care as we dedicate our efforts to ensure premium medical care and optimum patient welfare. 
Our world class specialties are continuously modified and improved to better suit the needs of our community. Caring forpatients from some of the most deprived communities, the hospital organises community-based outreach programmes         alongside our Patient Welfare Department to ensure that every person, regardless of their financial position, can       receive quality healthcare without any discrimination. Our pioneering culture led us to form Shalamar Institute of      Health Sciences (SIHS) as the umbrella organisation for Shalamar Hospital, Shalamar Medical & Dental College (SMDC),    Shalamar Nursing College (SNC) and Shalamar School of Allied Health Sciences. These educational institutions were       established to improve service delivery in tertiary healthcare. Our Shalamar Medical & Dental College is ranked amongst the top medical colleges affiliated with UHS. We aim to drive forward the strategic partnership between all             complimentary units to develop and enhance intellectual rigour, practical clinical skills required to work in diverse   settings, and instil a deep commitment to patient welfare.
